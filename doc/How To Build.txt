1. Clone the repo

2. IMPORTANT! Adding "electron-rebuild" as explained below, is NOT required when using 
   "electron-builder". If "electron-builder" is installed in devDependencies it is only
   required to add this line:
        
        "postinstall": "electron-builder install-app-deps",

   to the "scripts" section. Then if "npm start" or "npm run dist" is executed,
   electron-builder will make sure that the native binaries are rebuilt if required.
   This is just an explanation on how to do it without electron-builder. This page
   explains how to install/rebuild for Electron https://serialport.io/docs/en/guide-installation

    - npm install --save-dev electron-rebuild (if module is not in package.json already)

    - add "install" line below to package.json (if not done already)

        "scripts": {
            "start": "electron .",
            "install": "electron-rebuild"
        }

3. npm install

4a. Increase version number in package.json
4b. Increase version number in about.html
4c. Update CHANGELOG.txt

5. Update SHA256.txt file

5. npm run dist       (Creates the installer in ./dist directory)

OR

5. npm start          (to just start the app)
