Rebuild native module:
    NODE_MODULE_VERSION refers to the ABI (application binary interface) version number of Node.js, used to determine which versions of Node.js compiled C++ add-on binaries can be loaded in to without needing to be re-compiled. It used to be stored as hex value in earlier versions, but is now represented as an integer. https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/
